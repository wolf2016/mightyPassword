-   In your chosen tool, navigate to where you downloaded the code. Ex. `E:\dev\mightyPassword>`
-   enter `npm install` to install all of the dependencies for this project.
-   To run the Mighty Strong Password Checker, enter `npx http-server`
-   After a few seconds, it should say it is available and you should be able to access it here http://localhost:8080/src/index.html

-   To run the actual tests against the checker, you have a few options:
-   `npm run SmokeTest` this will run the smoke tests
-   `npm run featureTest` this will run the tests that are required for this version.
-   `npm run allTests` this would run all tests, including any api, regression etc. (I didn't create those; that's just an example of what it could run if I took more time).
